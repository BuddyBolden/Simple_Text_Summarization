<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Let's turn to a more complex approach! But before, you need to preprocess the data. In this stage, you will perform its tokenization and lemmatization. You will also need to remove the stopwords from the texts. To delete them, load the corpus of stopwords for English as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">from nltk.corpus import stopwords


stop_words = stopwords.words('english')
</code></pre>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">You need to download the corpus of stopwords in advance. You can do that with the following line: <code class="language-xml">nltk.download('stopwords')</code>.</div>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Steps 1-4 are the same as in the first stage. The second stage implies completing the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read an XML file with news texts.</li>
<li>Extract the headers and the news texts.</li>
<li>Start processing each news story: first, tokenize the text into separate sentences with <code class="language-xml">nltk</code>.</li>
<li>Find <em><span class="math-tex">\(\sqrt{N}\)</span></em>  (<em><em><span class="math-tex">\(N\)</span></em></em> is the number of the source text's sentences).</li>
<li>Tokenize sentences into words using the <code class="language-xml">word_tokenize()</code> function from <code class="language-xml">nltk</code>.</li>
<li>Convert the tokenized words to lowercase.</li>
<li>Get rid of punctuation and stopwords. Below, you can find a detailed description of characters and character sequences that should be excluded.</li>
<li>Lemmatize each word via the <code class="language-xml">WordNetLemmatizer</code>. Mind that by default this lemmatizer deals only with nouns. At this stage, you do NOT need to assign POS tags to words, just use the default <code class="language-xml">pos='n'</code> parameter.</li>
<li>Extract and print the headers and the first <span class="math-tex">\(\sqrt{N}\)</span> <strong>lemmatized</strong> sentences, where <em><em><span class="math-tex">\(N\)</span></em></em> is the number of the source text's sentences for each piece of news. To print the first sentences, you should transform <em><em><span class="math-tex">\(\sqrt{N}\)</span></em></em> into an integer with the help of the <code class="language-xml">round()</code> function. Use <code class="language-xml">join()</code> to combine the list of lemmas into a sentence as shown in the example below.</li>
</ol>
<p>To get rid of punctuation, please, use <code class="language-xml">string.punctuation</code>. Mind that you need to remove a punctuation character only if it occurs as the standalone token: for example, <code class="language-xml">,</code> and <code class="language-xml">:</code> should be removed from the text, whereas <code class="language-xml">'s</code> should stay as it is, you do not need to remove it at all.</p>
<p>Your program does not get any input in this stage: you should just read the news from the <em>news.xml</em> file. Do not make any changes to this file. The number of news pieces in one file may vary. An example of its structure can be found in the Example section.</p>
<p>Once you got the summaries for each piece of news, print them as you did in the first stage.</p>

      &lt;value name="head"&gt;New Portuguese skull may be an early relative of Neandertals&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;value name="text"&gt;Half a million years ago, several different members of our genus, Homo, had spread throughout Europe and Asia, where some would eventually evolve into Neandertals. 
      But which ones has been the subject of intense debate. 
      A newly discovered partial skull is offering another clue to help solve the mystery of the ancestry of Neandertals. 
      Found in 2014 in the Gruta da Aroeira cave in central Portugal with ancient stone hand axes, the skull (3D reconstruction pictured) is firmly dated to 400,000 years old and an archaic member of our genus, according to a study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
      The skull shows a new mix of features not seen before in fossil humans - it has traits that link it to Neandertals, such as a fused brow ridge, as well as some primitive traits that resemble other extinct fossils in Europe. 
      This new combination of features on a well-dated skull may help researchers sort out how different fossils in Europe are related to each other - and which ones eventually evolved into Neandertals.&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/news&gt;

      &lt;value name="head"&gt;Loneliness May Make Quitting Smoking Even Tougher&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;value name="text"&gt;Being lonely may make it harder to quit smoking, a new British study suggests.
      Using genetic and survey data from hundreds of thousands of people, researchers found that loneliness makes it more likely that someone will smoke.
      This type of analysis is called Mendelian randomization.
      ' This method has never been applied to this question before and so the results are novel, but also tentative,'  said co-lead author Robyn Wootton, a senior research associate at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom.
      ' We found evidence to suggest that loneliness leads to increased smoking, with people more likely to start smoking, to smoke more cigarettes and to be less likely to quit,'  Wootton said in a university news release.
      These data mesh with an observation that during the coronavirus pandemic, more British people are smoking.
      Senior study author Jorien Treur said, ' Our finding that smoking may also lead to more loneliness is tentative, but it is in line with other recent studies that identified smoking as a risk factor for poor mental health.
      A potential mechanism for this relationship is that nicotine from cigarette smoke interferes with neurotransmitters such as dopamine in the brain.' 
      Treur is a visiting research associate from Amsterdam UMC.
      The researchers also looked for a connection between loneliness and drinking but found none.
      Still, if loneliness causes people to smoke, it is important to alert smoking cessation services so they can add this factor as they help people to quit, the study authors said.
      The report was published June 16 in the journal Addiction.&lt;/value&gt;
